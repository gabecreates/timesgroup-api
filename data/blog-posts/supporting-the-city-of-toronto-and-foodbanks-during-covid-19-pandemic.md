  Times Group, the City of Toronto and the University Health Network have
  partnered to deploy two vacant Times Group buildings as temporary shelter
  facilities under the City of Toronto Streets to Homes program. Times Group
  principals Hashem Ghadaki, Saeid Aghaei, Mohammad Ghadaki and Ali Mesgarzadeh
  have pledged to donate the net proceeds from the lease to help support two
  Toronto area foodbanks, <a href="http://www.dailybread.ca/"

  The two buildings will provide furnished apartments to house the city’s most vulnerable groups during the Covid-19 pandemic and accommodate up to 130 clients on eight floors. Each client will have independent kitchen and bathroom facilities and both buildings are completely accessible. The site will be operational for between 3-6 months depending on the timeline for resolving the Covid-19 pandemic in the City of Toronto. “Our partnership with the City at this unprecedented time in history enables us to provide living space for the most vulnerable when it is needed most. Additionally, with the lease proceeds, we have committed to donating $500,000 to Toronto’s food banks,” said Hashem Ghadaki, President of Times Group. “Speaking for my partners and our entire staff, we feel it’s our duty as citizens to help.”
