  target="_blank">Toronto Star</a>, Times Group and the City of Toronto have
  partnered to create a space to accommodate the city’s next wave of asylum
  seekers. A former Toronto Hydro operation centre in North York has been
  refurbished and retrofitted to function as a 300-400 bed refugee welcome
  centre as of November 1, 2018. The vacant building, a former 88,000 square
  foot Toronto Hydro operation centre located in North York and acquired by
  Times Group in 2018, will accommodate refugee families and individuals.

  The Times Group principals – who themselves immigrated to Canada 30 years ago – partnered with the City of Toronto in order to support its efforts to properly accommodate the growing numbers of asylum seekers arriving in the greater Toronto area. “We are very excited to be working with the City to provide resettlement space for refugees who have come to Canada to rebuild their lives,” said Ali Mesgarzadeh, President of Life Construction Inc. “Given the urgent need for space our team was happy to help,” he added.
