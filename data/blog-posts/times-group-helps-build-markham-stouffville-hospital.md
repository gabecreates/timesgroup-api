  Times Group and <a href="https://www.msh.on.ca/" target="_blank">Markham
  Stouffville Hospital</a> are working together to help build a landmark
  expansion to the facilities of MSH. To help support the expansion plans, Times
  Group has pledged a gift of $500,000 which will help deliver more beds and
  operating rooms to help serve the growing Markham community. “Health care is a
  universal cause – it benefits everyone. The best way to give back to the
  community is to give to our hospitals because these gifts will have a profound
  impact.” said Saeid Aghaei, Principal, of Times Group.

  Plans also include building on the hospital’s excellence in diagnostic imaging and adding more clinic space so the community can better access wellness services, such as rehabilitation and diabetes education. “We are lucky to have an excellent health-care system and we want to ensure that our community continues to receive equal access to excellent care.” said Hashem Ghadaki, President of Times Group.
