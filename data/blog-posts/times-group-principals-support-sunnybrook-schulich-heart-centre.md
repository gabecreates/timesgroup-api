  Times Group President Hashem Ghadaki and wife Rana Ghadaki have pledged
  $500,000 to the <a
  href="https://sunnybrook.ca/content/?page=schulich-heart-centre"
  target="_blank">Sunnybrook Schulich Heart Centre</a> to help fund research
  into type B aortic dissection treatments. Type B dissections are typically
  managed with medication to lower blood pressure. However, evidence shows that
  more than half of the patients will go on to require complex, high-risk
  surgery. It’s precisely that kind of invasive, emergency surgery that Dr.
  Daryl Kucey, a Sunnybrook vascular surgeon, is now hoping to avoid. A leading
  expert in type B aortic dissections involving tears in the inner lining of the
  descending aorta, Dr. Kucey is searching for alternative treatments.

  “What we’re hoping to do is treat them more aggressively in the acute phase to eliminate these high-risk procedures down the road,” Dr. Kucey explains. He is leading a trial at Sunnybrook to test this theory, just the first of a series of studies to be funded by the gift. If successful, the trial could lead to new protocols for how to treat patients with a type B aortic dissection – establishing a new global standard of care. “This research will make a real impact on patient care,” he says. “None of this would be possible without the support of Times Group and the Ghadaki family.”
