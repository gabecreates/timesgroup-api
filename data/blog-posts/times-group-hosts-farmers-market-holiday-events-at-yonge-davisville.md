  Times Group and Appletree Markets (<a href="http://www.dailyapple.ca/"
  target="_blank">Daily Apple</a>) have partnered to help bring community events
  and a weekly farmers market to the Times Group owned commercial parking lot
  located in Midtown Toronto at Yonge and Davisville. The partnership plans to
  host recurring holiday events in the space including a fall Seed and Kernel
  Festival and Christmas Merriment holiday market. These events have been
  sponsored by Times Group and the Midtown BIA. Times Group has also dedicated a
  portion of the parking lot for an annual holiday tree to animate the space.
  “Times recognized the importance of Davisville Village, and together we have
  created unique events and opportunities to celebrate our wonderful and
  culturally diverse community,” said Chris Trussell, co-founder of Appletree
  Markets.
