  With River Park, Times Group introduced the first phase of Uptown Markham, a
  stunning array of low and highrise condominium residences set along the Rouge
  River valley. River Park residences are elegant, energy efficient, low
  maintenance and affordable.

  With terraces, balconies, decorative railings, plasters and columns, the
  European style accents the siteâ€™s natural surroundings, contributing to the
  dynamic growth of the communities of Markham and Unionville. At the heart of
  the community is a European-style plaza, over 150,000 square feet of
  neighbourhood shops, services and supermarkets counting Whole Foods Market,
  Panera Breads, LCBO and major banks among the anchor tenants at Uptown Market.
  All this in the finest and most prestigious location north of Toronto.
