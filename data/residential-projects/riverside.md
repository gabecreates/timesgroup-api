  With its sleek and contemporary exterior of brick and stone finish, large
  luminous windows and beautiful roof gardens, Riverside is situated alongside
  Uptown Markham’s expansive park and beautifully landscaped venue for local
  festivals and municipal events, outdoor markets, exhibits, and public art.
  Offering a vast array of social and recreational amenities, Riverside is the
  first building on Highway 7 to feature an outdoor swimming pool. Perched on
  the rooftop of the building’s 10th floor, the expansive pool features a
  spacious sundeck and landscaped terrace with BBQs, an indoor Lounge with a bar
  and TV screens and guest suites. Inside residents will find a well-equipped
  fitness centre, ping pong, billiards and card rooms, a library/Wi-Fi lounge,
  and a spectacular party room complete with dining area and bar, servery, and
  access to a quiet outdoor patio facing the Rouge River.
