description: >-
  Exclusivity, elegance and grace come together in the magnificent Galleria
  Tower in Thornhill with its contemporary facade of precast stone and stucco.
  Expansive windows and spacious terraces soar above a charming residential
  neighbourhood marked by style and distinction. A small and select group of
  Townhomes surrounded by landscaped gardens overlooks one of the Galleria
  parks. The community is an ideal address for couples and young families of all
  sizes.
