description: >-
  The heritage architecture of Derby Tower pays homage to Markham’s tradition,
  with granite Victorian brickwork and varying heights of classical cornices in
  its roots. The interior of the 124-unit building exudes classical upscale
  European elegance with rich detailing that reflects the discriminating tastes
  of those who make Derby Tower their home. From the coffered ceiling to the
  Persian carpets, to the stone fireplace and expanses of granite, limestone and
  marble that define the lobby’s seating areas, the meticulous attention to
  detail makes Derby Tower a rare find. Derby Tower won the Best Building Award
  from the Town of Markham.
