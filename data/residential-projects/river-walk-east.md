  River Walk East is a residence composed of two buildings of eight and 20
  stories that build on the success of River Park. Overlooking the valley, River
  Walk East is located directly beside the centrally situated park within the
  Uptown Markham community. At the heart of the community is a commercial plaza
  with over 150,000 square feet of neighbourhood shops, services and
  supermarkets counting Whole Foods Market, Panera Breads, LCBO and major banks
  among the anchor tenants at Uptown Market. With its gracious European-inspired
  exterior, the residence will offer a carefree condominium lifestyle with an
  outstanding selection of suite designs – all energy-efficient to LEED® Gold
  standards. All this in the finest and most prestigious location north of
  Toronto.<br><br>
