  A touch of country in the city, located at 135 Pond Drive in Thornhill,
  Saddlecreek is named for the equine estate that once occupied the land and the
  stream flowing through here. It is the first of the condominiums built in the
  Galleria community master plan and offers a touch of the country in the city.
  Walking distance to two major plazas just across the street, the 129-unit
  condominium bridges the rural and the urban. A few steps from a grassy meadow
  at their doorstep, residents enjoy a wide choice of restaurants, shops, banks,
  and other services, and a 30-minute drive whisks them to the heart of downtown
  Toronto.
