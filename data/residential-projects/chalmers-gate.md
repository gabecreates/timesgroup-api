  A chic red brick low-rise just off of Highway 7, Chalmers Gate is
  strategically located in the midst of all the Richmond Hill action. With easy
  access to major highways and walking distance to a VIVA station,
  transportation is quick and efficient. Straddling between two plazas, Chalmers
  Gate also provides the convenience of a wide range of services and shops at
  walking distance.
