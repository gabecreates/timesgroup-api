  Located off of Highway 7, between Leslie Street and Bayview Avenue, Eden Park
  II is part of a well-established community that’s home to over one thousand
  satisfied families. Comprised of two spectacularly designed highrise
  condominiums and 22 executive townhomes, Eden Park II is located on a green
  and open park within an enchanting oasis-like setting. But, more than that,
  Eden Park II is another Times Group project being built to a LEED® Gold
  standard – the absolute ultimate in energy efficient and environmentally
  friendly design. Minutes from Thornhill’s international shops and restaurants,
  Eden Park is poised to become one of the most sought-after condominiums north
  of Toronto. Amenities include indoor swimming pool, fully equipped gym
  facility, a library, a movie theatre room, a games room equipped with pool
  table and a beautifully-appointed party room.
